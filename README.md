# React Repository

This Repo serves as a warehouse to keep track of any app, demo or training session towards my learning with Redux, in all its magical rareness and beauty.

Ordered in a way each step guides me further into more complex topics.

###Getting this locally###

Each folder contains an specific app, which can be tested locally by doing the following.

Click [here](https://github.com/Tora1024/Redux-Learning-Process/archive/master.zip) then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

Now open you browser with 'Localhost:8080' to test it out locally.
